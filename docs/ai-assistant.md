## Core Components

### 1. Natural Language Processing Engine

The NLP engine is responsible for understanding user inputs and converting them into structured representations that can be processed by the AI system.

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Intent Recognition | GPT-4, BERT | Identify the user's goal or request |
| Entity Extraction | Named Entity Recognition Models | Extract key information like symptoms, medications, dates |
| Context Manager | In-memory state + vector embedding | Maintain conversation context and reference history |
| Language Identification | CLD3, fastText | Detect language for multilingual support |

**Offline Capabilities:**
- Lightweight ONNX models for basic intent recognition
- Pre-cached entity recognition patterns
- Local conversation context storage

### 2. Knowledge Retrieval System

The knowledge retrieval system accesses and processes information from various sources to inform the AI Assistant's responses.

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Vector Database | Pinecone, Chroma | Store and retrieve semantically similar information |
| Medical Knowledge Base | UMLS, SNOMED CT Integration | Access standardized medical information |
| User Knowledge Base | Patient Records + Preferences | Personalize responses based on patient history |
| Evidence Retriever | PubMed API, Medical Guidelines DB | Source evidence-based information |

**Integration Points:**
- Medical terminology standardization with UMLS
- Patient record federation for contextual understanding
- Cultural knowledge integration for appropriate guidance

### 3. Dialog Management System

The dialog manager orchestrates the conversation flow and ensures coherent, helpful interactions.

    participant NLP as NLP Engine
    participant Context as Context Manager
    participant Dialog as Dialog Manager
    participant Knowledge as Knowledge Retrieval
    participant Response as Response Generator
    
    User->>NLP: "I've been feeling dizzy lately"
    NLP->>Context: Update conversation context
    NLP->>Dialog: Intent: Report_Symptom, Entity: Symptom(dizzy)
    Dialog->>Knowledge: Query(symptom:dizzy, user_context, medical_context)
    Knowledge->>Dialog: Relevant information (causes, related conditions)
    Dialog->>Response: Generate response with retrieved knowledge
    Response->>User: "Dizziness can have several causes. Have you experienced any other symptoms like headaches or nausea?"
    User->>NLP: "Yes, I've had headaches"
    NLP->>Context: Update with new symptom
    Context->>Dialog: Updated context with multiple symptoms
    Dialog->>Knowledge: Query(symptoms:[dizzy,headache], user_context, medical_context)
    Knowledge->>Dialog: Updated relevant information
    Dialog->>Response: Generate response with new context
    Response->>User: "Dizziness with headaches could indicate several conditions. Would you like me to help schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider?"
```

### 4. Response Generation System

The response generator creates natural, informative, and culturally appropriate responses.

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Template Engine | Handlebars, GPT-4 | Structure responses for different scenarios |
| Personalization Engine | User Preference Models | Adapt tone, detail level, and terminology |
| Cultural Adaptation | Cultural Safety Rules Engine | Ensure cultural appropriateness |
| Multilingual Generation | Neural Machine Translation | Support indigenous and other languages |

**Response Quality Controls:**
- Medical accuracy verification against knowledge base
- Uncertainty expression for non-definitive information
- Cultural sensitivity review for appropriate terminology
- Simplification for health literacy levels

### 5. Action Management System

The action manager executes tasks based on user requests and conversation context.

| Action Type | Integration Points | Capabilities |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Appointment Scheduling | Calendar API, Provider Availability | Book, reschedule, cancel appointments |
| Health Record Access | Patient Record System | Retrieve, summarize, explain health data |
| Medication Management | Medication Database, Reminder System | Set up reminders, answer medication questions |
| Health Education | Content Repository, Learning Platform | Deliver personalized educational content |

## Cultural Safety Integration

Cultural safety is deeply integrated into the AI Assistant architecture:

```mermaid

    subgraph "Cultural Safety Integration"
        LM[Language Models] --> Adaptation[Cultural Adaptation Layer]
        Adaptation --> LanguageVar[Language Variations]
        Adaptation --> CulturalContext[Cultural Context]
        Adaptation --> HealthBeliefs[Health Beliefs]
        
        CKB[Cultural Knowledge Base] --> Adaptation
        CommunityFB[Community Feedback] --> CKB
        
        Adaptation --> ResponseFilter[Response Filter]
        ResponseFilter --> UI[User Interface]
    end
```

Key cultural safety features include:
- Indigenous language support with medical terminology mapping
- Traditional knowledge integration with Western medical concepts
- Community-validated response patterns
- Cultural protocols for sensitive health topics
- Elder wisdom incorporation

## Offline-First Architecture

The AI Assistant implements a sophisticated offline capability system:

        Browser --> IndexedDB[IndexedDB Storage]
        Browser --> PWA[Progressive Web App Cache]
        
        LocalModels --> ONNX[ONNX Runtime]
        LocalModels --> TFLite[TensorFlow Lite]
        
        IndexedDB --> ConvHistory[Conversation History]
        IndexedDB --> UserData[User Data]
        IndexedDB --> KnowledgeCache[Knowledge Cache]
        
        SyncManager[Background Sync] --> API[Server API]
        NetworkStatus[Network Status Monitor] --> SyncManager
    end
```

## Privacy and Security

The AI Assistant prioritizes privacy and security:

| Feature | Implementation | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Data Minimization | Need-to-know processing | Process only necessary information |

| Encrypted Storage | AES-256 encryption | Protect stored conversation history |
| Consent Management | Granular permissions | Clear opt-in for health data access |
| Audit Logging | Secure activity logs | Track all system actions for accountability |

## Performance Optimization

Performance optimizations ensure the AI Assistant works effectively in low-resource environments:

| Technique | Implementation | Benefit |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Model Quantization | 8-bit quantized models | Reduced model size for faster loading |
| Progressive Enhancement | Tiered capability loading | Basic functions work on all devices |
| Response Caching | Local cache for common queries | Reduced latency for frequent interactions |
