### 4. Offline Capability Architecture

KweCare implements a sophisticated offline-first approach using:

1. **Local Data Persistence**
   - Patient records cached in localStorage/sessionStorage
   - IndexedDB for larger health datasets

2. **TensorFlow.js for Client-Side AI**
   - Models loaded and run entirely in the browser
   - Simplified fallback models for lower-end devices
   - Periodic model updates when online

3. **Network-Aware Sync**
   - Background synchronization when connectivity returns
   - Queue-based operations for pending changes
   - Conflict resolution strategies

4. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Core features work without connectivity
   - Enhanced features activate when online
   - Graceful degradation when resources are limited
