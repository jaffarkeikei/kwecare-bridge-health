### Progressive Enhancement Strategy

KweCare employs a progressive enhancement strategy that adapts to available device resources and connectivity:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Progressive Enhancement"
        Capabilities[Capabilities] --> Basic[Basic Tier]
        Capabilities --> Standard[Standard Tier]
        Capabilities --> Enhanced[Enhanced Tier]
        
        Basic --> EssentialDiag[Essential Diagnostics]
        Basic --> TextOnly[Text-Only Interface]
        Basic --> KeySymptoms[Key Symptom Analysis]
        
        Standard --> FullDiag[Full Diagnostic Suite]
        Standard --> ImageInput[Image Input]

## AI Model Update System

KweCare includes a sophisticated model update system to ensure models remain current while respecting bandwidth limitations:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Device
    participant UpdateService
    participant ModelRegistry
    
    Device->>UpdateService: Check for updates
    UpdateService->>ModelRegistry: Query latest versions
    ModelRegistry->>UpdateService: Return model metadata
    UpdateService->>Device: Send model details
    
    alt Update Available
        Device->>Device: Check device resources
        
        alt Priority Update
            Device->>UpdateService: Request immediate download
            UpdateService->>Device: Stream model
            Device->>Device: Install and verify
        else Background Update
            Device->>UpdateService: Queue for background download
            Device->>Device: Download during low-usage period
            Device->>Device: Install during idle time
        else Chunked Update
            Device->>UpdateService: Request chunked download
            loop Until Complete
                UpdateService->>Device: Send model chunk
                Device->>Device: Store chunk
            end
            Device->>Device: Assemble and install model
        end
    end
```

### Update Considerations:

- **Size Optimization**: Models use weight quantization and pruning
- **Delta Updates**: Only changed portions are downloaded when possible
- **Connectivity-Aware**: Downloads occur only on WiFi or strong signals
- **Battery-Aware**: Background updates pause when battery is low
- **Prioritization**: Critical health models update first
- **Verification**: Models are cryptographically verified before installation
