# KweCare: Healing Without Borders

![KweCare Logo](assets/logo.png)

## üåü Overview

KweCare is a revolutionary healthcare application designed to bridge healthcare gaps for remote Indigenous communities in Canada. By combining offline AI diagnostics, satellite telemedicine, and culturally sensitive design, KweCare ensures equitable access to specialized healthcare for populations facing geographic, technological, and cultural barriers.

## üè• The Problem

Remote Indigenous communities in Canada face significant healthcare challenges:

- **3x higher rates** of diabetes and chronic diseases
- **Limited access** to specialists (endocrinologists, cardiologists, etc.)
- **Cultural disconnect** in healthcare delivery
- **Unreliable internet connectivity**, making traditional telemedicine ineffective
- **Health sovereignty concerns** with management of sensitive health data

## üí° Our Solution

KweCare addresses these challenges through four integrated components:

### 1. Offline AI Diagnostics
- **AI-Powered Symptom Checker**: Pre-loaded TensorFlow Lite models analyze symptoms, vital signs, and images without internet
- **Predictive Alerts**: AI identifies risks for diabetes, hypertension, and infections, providing guidance in Indigenous languages
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functions work offline, enhanced capabilities activate when online

### 2. Satellite Telemedicine
- **Low-Bandwidth Video Consultations**: Integration with Starlink API for secure, high-quality calls with urban specialists
- **Data Syncing**: Records save locally and upload automatically when connectivity resumes
- **Store-and-Forward**: Critical data can be queued for transmission when connectivity becomes available

### 3. Cultural Safety Features
- **Indigenous Language Support**: Full UI, voice commands, and content in Cree, Inuktitut, Ojibwe, Michif, and Denesuline
- **Traditional Knowledge Integration**: Educational modules co-designed with Elders and Knowledge Keepers
- **Traditional Medicine Database**: Contextualized information about indigenous healing practices
- **Community Resources**: Connection to local health workers and cultural supports

### 4. Dual User Experience
- **Patient Portal**: Self-monitoring tools, appointment scheduling, and health education
- **Healthcare Provider Portal**: Patient management, clinical decision support, and cultural context resources
- **Seamless Bridging**: Smooth data sharing between patients and providers with explicit consent controls

## üß† Key Innovations

1. **Dual-Role Architecture**: Seamless switching between patient and healthcare provider experiences
2. **Cultural Safety By Design**: Indigenous languages, knowledge, and practices embedded throughout
3. **Offline Intelligence**: Client-side TensorFlow.js models that adapt to available device resources
4. **Community Data Sovereignty**: Users control what personal and traditional knowledge is shared
