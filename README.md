# KweCare: Healing Without Borders

![KweCare Logo](assets/logo.png)

## 🌟 Overview

KweCare is a revolutionary Flutter-powered mobile application designed to bridge healthcare gaps for remote Indigenous communities in Canada. By combining offline AI diagnostics, satellite telemedicine, and culturally sensitive design, KweCare ensures equitable access to specialized healthcare for populations facing geographic, technological, and cultural barriers.

## 🏥 The Problem

Remote Indigenous communities in Canada face significant healthcare challenges:

- **3x higher rates** of diabetes and chronic diseases
- **Limited access** to specialists (endocrinologists, cardiologists, etc.)
- **Cultural disconnect** in healthcare delivery
- **Unreliable internet connectivity**, making traditional telemedicine ineffective

## 💡 Our Solution

KweCare addresses these challenges through four integrated components:

### 1. Offline AI Diagnostics
- **AI-Powered Symptom Checker**: Pre-loaded TensorFlow Lite models analyze symptoms, vital signs, and images without internet
- **Predictive Alerts**: AI identifies risks for diabetes, hypertension, and infections, providing guidance in Indigenous languages

### 2. Satellite Telemedicine
- **Low-Bandwidth Video Consultations**: Integration with Starlink API for secure, high-quality calls with urban specialists
- **Data Syncing**: Records save locally and upload automatically when connectivity resumes

### 3. Cultural Safety Features
- **Indigenous Language Support**: Voice commands and text in Cree, Inuktitut, and Ojibwe
- **Traditional Knowledge Integration**: Educational modules co-designed with Elders

### 4. Community Empowerment
- **Local Health Worker Portal**: Tools for Community Health Workers to triage patients, track health trends, and coordinate care
